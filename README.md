### Input Options  
1. **Single Text Analysis**:  
      - A user can enter any text or sentence in the provided text box.
      - Upon clicking the "Analyze Emotion" button, the app processes the input and classifies it into one of the predefined emotional categories such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, or Surprise.

---

### Output Features  

1. **Sentiment Classification**:  
   - Each input text or dataset entry is labeled with a specific emotion such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, or Surprise. This helps users quickly grasp the dominant emotional tone of each text.

These outputs enable quick, clear, and actionable insights for text-level sentiment analysis. üéØ
